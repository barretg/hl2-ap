## What does randomization do to this game?

Half-Life 2's campaign is cut into its own 14 chapters, from Point Insertion to
Dark Energy. Instead of playing straight through, you travel to a chapter from a
hub, and a chapter is locked until the multiworld sends its unlock item.
Finishing a chapter returns you to the hub.

Weapons are locked too. Every weapon but the crowbar has to be received before
you can pick one up: walking over a shotgun you have not been sent leaves it
where it is. The check for finding it still fires.

Dark Energy has no unlock item. It opens once you have finished a configurable
number of other chapters.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

**Items:** one unlock per chapter, one per weapon, the gravity gun as four
Progressive Gravity Guns, keys for the airboat and the buggy in each chapter
that drives one, the Airboat and Buggy Guns, optionally the HEV suit, the
flashlight, Progressive Aux Power and an added melee throw (very fun, highly recommend), 
plus filler (ammo, medkits, batteries) and traps.

**Locations:** 169.

- reaching each part of a chapter, and finishing the chapter
- pressing use on each of the 41 health chargers and 33 suit chargers, empty or
  not; these can be switched off with `chargesanity`
- the first pickup of each weapon, of the HEV suit, and of the super gravity gun

## What does another world's item look like in Half-Life 2?

There is no world model for it: locations are places and things that were
already in Half-Life 2. Making a check prints a line in the game naming what you
found.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

It is announced in chat, and takes effect immediately: a chapter becomes
enterable, a weapon becomes collectable and is put in your hands, filler is
granted where you stand. A trap springs a few seconds after it arrives, once the
level has settled.

## What is the goal?

Finish Dark Energy: it opens after `missions_required` other chapters, and its
closing credits goal the slot.

## Unique local commands

Typed in chat (`Y`) with a `!` in front, or in the game console (`~`) as
`ap <command>`:

- `!ap`: every chapter and its unlock status
- `!warp <number or name>`: travel to an unlocked chapter
- `!warp <chapter> <part>`: travel to a part of a chapter you have reached
- `!setwarp [name]`, `!warps`: make and list warp points of your own
- `!hub`: return to the hub
- `!tracker [filter]`: locations found and still out there
- `!find [text]`: point at the nearest unfound check
- `!trace [text]`: draw a path to it
- `!menu`: warps, the tracker, find and trace as a menu (the `-` key)
- `!status`, `!help`
